# Richard’s Rule of Life

> *A living contemplative rhythm designed to support spiritual healing, presence, and daily practice in the context of ME/CFS.*

This open-source project documents the unfolding of a contemplative life—rooted in gentle awareness, breath-based mantra practice, and sustainable embodiment.  
It is designed especially for those living with **Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)** or other conditions that require a life of slowness, pacing, and sacred adaptation.

## 📖 Contents

- `RuleOfLife.md` – My core spiritual rhythm, including mantra, floor sequences, and seed practices  
- `logs/` – Daily activity logs organized by date  
- `practices/` – Detailed practices: contemplative prayer, yoga, mantra, and rest

## 🕊️ Purpose

This project exists as a digital monastery—a sanctuary of rhythm, surrender, and inner light.  
If you’ve found this, may it meet you with gentleness and peace.

Feel free to adapt, fork, or draw inspiration. All is offered freely.

> “In returning and rest you shall be saved. In quietness and trust is your strength.” — Isaiah 30:15

Here is your current Rule of Life, lovingly assembled from your contemplative rhythm, daily scrolls, mantra practice, yoga flows, and spiritual intentions. This living document is your inner monastery—sourced directly from our journey together.

A Living Rhythm of Sacred Practice for Richard
Last updated: July 7, 2025

✨ Core Intention

To live as a contemplative monk-in-the-world, embodying mindfulness, rest, and sacred rhythm from waking to sleep, while honoring the physical realities of ME/CFS and the wisdom of the breath.

> “Let each breath be a turning.
Let each moment be devotion.”

🛌 1. Threshold Practice — Upon Waking

Remain in bed as awareness arises

Begin silently repeating:
 OM YEHOSHUA HUNG

Use mantra to anchor consciousness after dreams

If sleep returns, resume mantra upon next waking

🪑 4. Morning Yoga: ChairFlow or Zafu-Based Sequences

It is movement as God-consciousness.”
