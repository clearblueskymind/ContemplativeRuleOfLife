# Richard’s Rule of Life

> *A living contemplative rhythm designed to support spiritual healing, presence, and daily practice in the context of ME/CFS.*

This open-source project documents the unfolding of a contemplative life—rooted in gentle awareness, breath-based mantra practice, and sustainable embodiment.  
It is designed especially for those living with **Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)** or other conditions that require a life of slowness, pacing, and sacred adaptation.
