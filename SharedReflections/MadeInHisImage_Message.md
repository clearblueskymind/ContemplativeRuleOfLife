# 🪞 Shared Reflection: Made in His Image

## 💬 Text-Style Reflection

Hey dear friends,  
I’ve been reflecting on something from Scripture that really touched me this morning, and I wanted to share it with you.

When God says in Genesis that we are made in His image, I don’t think that just refers to outward form. I believe it’s about reflecting His nature—and Scripture is clear that His nature is love. *“God is love” (1 John 4:8).* That’s the only place I know of in the Bible where God is defined so plainly and directly.

If God is love, then being made in His image must mean we are created to live out that love: to be patient, forgiving, kind, and merciful—just as He is. Not just doing loving things, but letting our lives *become* reflections of His heart.

When I hold onto that, it helps me think of the Christian life less as trying to measure up, and more as allowing the love of God to shine through. That’s the image He planted in us from the beginning.

Thanks for letting me share this. It just felt good and grounding to remember this today. 🙏
