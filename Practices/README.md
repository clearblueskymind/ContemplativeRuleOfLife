# 📿 Practices Folder

This folder holds structured contemplative and physical practices developed by Richard to support a sustainable, spiritually centered life while living with ME/CFS.

These are not performance-based routines.  
They are sacred rhythms—rooted in pacing, presence, and compassion.

## 🌿 Contents

- Mindful movement (seated, standing, or mat-based)
- Breath-based mantra repetition
- Adapted yoga or somatic exercises
- Stillness and silence
- Sequences informed by sacred traditions (Buddhist, Hebrew, Christian mysticism)

They are about remembering what is already whole.”
