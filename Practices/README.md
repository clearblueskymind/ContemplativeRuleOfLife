# 📿 Practices Folder

This folder holds structured contemplative and physical practices developed by Richard to support a sustainable, spiritually centered life while living with ME/CFS.

These are not performance-based routines.  
They are sacred rhythms—rooted in pacing, presence, and compassion.

## 🛏️ Adaptability & Pacing (ME/CFS Awareness)

Each practice can be:
- Shortened or expanded based on energy level  
- Adapted for Red / Yellow / Green days  
- Used as a template for crafting your own sacred rhythm

These practices are designed with **ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)** in mind, where energy must be carefully managed to prevent crashes or post-exertional malaise (PEM).

Richard uses a color-coded pacing system common in ME/CFS communities:

- 🟥 **Red Day:** Energy is critically low. Only minimal movement, deep rest, and breath awareness may be possible.
- 🟡 **Yellow Day:** Some gentle activity is accessible—rest is still primary, but light movement and mantra may be helpful.
- 🟢 **Green Day:** A rare or moderate day of higher capacity—extended sequences, mindful stretching, and contemplative flow are possible.

Each practice in this folder is:
- Scalable for any energy state  
- Gentle enough to adapt on the spot  
- Rooted in kindness rather than achievement

> *These are not routines for the body to conquer.  
They are spaces where the spirit can rest inside the body.*

They are about remembering what is already whole.”
