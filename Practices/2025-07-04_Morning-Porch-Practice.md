## 🪷 Lotus Flower Verbal Flow  
*A contemplative cue set for embodied prayer*

---

### 1. Wake-Up Threshold Mantra  
> “In the stillness before thought, let OM return.  
> OM YEHOSHUA HUNG… again and again.  
> Not to control the mind—but to return to presence.”

---

### 2. Morning Bathroom Ritual  
> “Water on hands. Water on face.  
> Bless these limbs that will hold the day.  
> Let the mouth speak truth. Let the skin glow with peace.”

---

### 3. Porch Setup  
> “Step out as if stepping into a sanctuary.  
> Water the plants. They drink the dawn as you do.  
> Sit. Breathe. Begin again.”

---

### 4. Seated Mantra Meditation  
> “With each inhale: OM YEHOSHUA…  
> With each exhale: HUNG…  
> Breath becomes remembrance.  
> You become the sound.”

---

### 5. Hip Circles + Spinal Flow  
> “Let the hips paint a circle in the air.  
> Loosen your roots.  
> Gently wave the spine like wind through a reed.  
> Look over your shoulder—see the past, release it.  
> Return to center.”

---

### 6. 5lb Dumbbell Shoulder Flow  
> “Sit grounded in half-lotus.  
> The dumbbell rests in your hand like a prayer.”

> “Inhale: curl the weight toward your heart.  
> Exhale: press overhead—reaching beyond thought.”

> “Inhale: release gently, letting it settle on your shoulder,  
> preparing for the triceps to carry the weight.  
> Exhale: rise again—strength without strain.”

> “Inhale: return the weight to your shoulder.  
> Exhale: lower with the reverse curl, letting gravity become your teacher.”

> “Switch sides.  
> Repeat.  
> This is surrender, strength, and rhythm made visible.”

---

### 7. Standing Chair-Supported Flow

> “Rise with help. Let the chair be your altar.”

> “Step back—hands on the chair.  
Let the spine stretch long into Modified Downward Dog.  
The hips float back. The breath lengthens.  
You are being gently pulled into presence.”

> “Now soften the elbows and rest on the chair.  
A Half Forward Bend. Let the spine drape.  
Knees bent if needed.  
A pause. A bow.”

> “Lower slowly into the Full Forward Bend.  
Fists to the floor. Spine curved.  
Let the world tilt and release your thoughts.”

> “Rise halfway. Then gently arch into the Standing Backbend.  
Let the heart lift to heaven.  
Breathe into the front body.”

> “Now step one foot back—feel the stretch in your calf.  
Use the chair for balance.  
Switch sides.  
Let the legs find their length.”

> “Stand steady, feet shoulder-width apart.  
Pick up your dumbbells.  
Inhale tall.  
Exhale: lean right—let the weight guide the stretch.  
Inhale to center.  
Exhale: lean left—open the side body.  
2 to 4 slow rounds.  
This is gravity’s gentle prayer.”

---

### 8. Forward Bend Inversion  
> “Let the head hang.  
> Let the spine curve.  
> Let the floor receive your weight like a blessing.  
> Nothing is upside down in God’s sight.”

---

### 9. Seiza Mantra Meditation  
> “Back on the bench.  
> OM with the inhale.  
> HUNG with the exhale.  
> Stillness as medicine.  
> Let the nervous system whisper:  
> ‘I’m safe here.’”

---

### 10. Seiza Neck Flow  
> “Clasp your wrist.  
> Let the chest rise like a sunrise.  
> Neck draws circles in the air—gentle orbits of care.  
> Look over the shoulder like looking over a lifetime.  
> Return slowly.”

---

### 11. Grounding Squat  
> “Drop low. Let the hips open.  
> Hands near. Then hands forward.  
> A bow. A stretch. A settling.  
> You are close to the earth now.  
> Let it steady you.”

---

### 12. Final Seal – Shikantaza  
> “Return to half-lotus.  
> No mantra.  
> No breath awareness.  
> No technique.  
> Just sitting.  
> Just God.  
> Just now.”

---

### 13. Transition Posture – Royal Seated Balance  
> “One foot flat, one knee down.  
> Spine straight. Arm resting.  
> You are the king, the queen, the monk, the mystic.  
> Switch sides.  
> Rise only when the body says yes.”

---

> *“Let the movement become silence. Let the silence become song.  
Let the day begin—not with force, but with peace.”*
