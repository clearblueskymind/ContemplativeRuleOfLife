## 🧭 Detailed Instructions for Each Practice
> *Expanded guidance and adaptations for any future seeker.*

---

### 1. Wake-Up Threshold Mantra
- Remain in bed, in the state between sleep and wakefulness.
- Begin internally repeating **OM YEHOSHUA HUNG** as soon as consciousness returns.
- Let the mantra call you into awareness gently, without strain.
- Drift in and out of sleep if needed; return to the mantra upon each waking.
- This is a threshold practice—**entrance into the day as sacred space**.

---

### 2. Morning Bathroom Ritual
- Use the toilet, then wash hands mindfully.
- Recite the Hebrew blessing **Al-Nitilat Yadayim**.
- Splash remaining water on face, neck, and hair as purification.
- Brush teeth and prepare for embodied presence.
- This ritual is the **bodily gate of the Rule of Life**.

---

### 3. Sunrise Porch Setup
- Fill a glass with fresh water.
- Step outside onto the porch.
- Water each of your plants, offering them a sip of life.
- Sit in half-lotus or upright supported posture, facing the fig tree or the light.
- This is your **place of sanctuary and offering**.

---

### 4. Mantra Meditation (20 Minutes)
- Sit quietly, repeating **OM YEHOSHUA HUNG** with each inhale and exhale.
- Allow variations to arise:
   - Inhale divine light through the crown; exhale light through the earth.
   - Inhale light into the heart; exhale radiance to all beings.
   - Rest awareness at the third eye.
- Conclude with:
   - **Shema Yisrael**  
   - **Hineni, Lord, Your servant is listening.**

---

### 5. Noise-Canceling Headset (PEM Protection)
- Wear to reduce auditory load from external noise (e.g., neighbor’s AC).
- This protects spoons (energy) and avoids PEM onset.
- Modern contemplative technology in service of sacred silence.

---

### 6. 5lb Dumbbell Lotus Sequence
- Remain seated in half-lotus.
- Hold 5lb dumbbell in one hand at a time.
- Movement cycle:
   1. Passive hang for shoulder stretch  
   2. Curl upward  
   3. Overhead press  
   4. Triceps extension (behind head)  
   5. Lower slowly to ground  
- Switch arms and repeat.
- Embodied strength as a **movement prayer**.

---

### 7. Standing Chair-Supported Flow
- Use chair arm for support when rising from seated.
- Transition into:
   - Modified Downward Dog (hands on chair, hips back)
   - Half forward bend (elbows on chair)
   - Full forward bend with **rounded spine and bent knees**, fists on floor
   - Standing backbend
   - Right and left calf stretches (lunging with chair support)
- Let breath guide transitions.
- Rounding the spine intentionally can facilitate **vertebral release**.

---

### 8. Forward Bend Inversion Practice
- In full forward bend, rest fists on ground, knees slightly bent.
- Allow your back to curve.
- Remain here as a gentle inversion.
- Begin with 1–2 minutes; aspire to build toward 30 minutes over time using a timer.
- This is your **safe alternative to headstand**—a devotional inversion.

---

### 9. Seiza Mantra Practice (20 Minutes)
- Sit on Seiza bench.
- Use breath-based mantra repetition:
   - Inhale: OM YEHOSHUA HUNG  
   - Exhale: OM YEHOSHUA HUNG
- Let the practice support **energy recalibration and inner stillness**.
- Ideal for PEM recovery.

---

### 10. Seiza Back & Neck Flow
- While seated, clasp left wrist with right hand behind your back.
- Gently lift the chest and allow a slight backbend.
- Optional: gently rotate or tilt the head into a full circular neck flow.
- Complete one full circle in each direction.
- Final movement: turn head gently to look over left shoulder, then right.
- This completes the **full cervical range of motion**.

---

### 11. Grounding Squat Sequence
- Use chair to assist in transitioning from Seiza to standing, then into a full yogic squat.
- Two variations:
   1. Hands near the body  
   2. Hands extended forward on floor (dog-like stretch)
- Feel the stretch in hips, ankles, lower back.
- Remain for ~5 minutes.
- Stand with assistance from the chair.

---

### 12. Final Seal — Shikantaza
- Return to half-lotus.
- Let all effort fall away.
- No mantra. No breath awareness. No technique.
- Just sit. Rest in being.
- This is the **non-practice beyond all practice.**
