## 🔹 Overview

**Kapalabhati** (कपालभाति) means “Skull-Shining Breath.”  
It is a yogic cleansing pranayama that awakens energy, clears mental fog, and brings light to the mind.

This practice consists of **3 rounds** of sharp, rhythmic exhales through the nose, with passive inhales.  
Each round closes by gently bringing awareness to the **third eye**, allowing the prana to collect and radiate.
