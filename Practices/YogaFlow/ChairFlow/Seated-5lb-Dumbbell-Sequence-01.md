## 🔹 Intention

A seated strength-and-surrender flow using 5lb dumbbells.  
Ideal for mornings, Yellow days, or when you seek a short but meaningful physical prayer.

---

## 🪑 Setup

- Seated in a supportive, upright chair  
- Spine lifted, feet grounded  
- 5lb dumbbell in one hand (alternate as needed)

---

## 🔁 Movement Cycle

1. **Let the dumbbell hang** — Arm relaxed, shoulder grounding  
2. **Neck release** — Gently tilt the head away from the weighted side  
3. **Inhale: Bicep curl** — Bring weight toward the heart  
4. **Exhale: Overhead press** — Extend upward with grace  
5. **Inhale: Triceps extension** — Lower behind the head  
6. **Exhale: Press overhead again**  
7. **Inhale: Lower to shoulder**  
8. **Exhale: Reverse curl to resting position**

Repeat 2–4 rounds per arm

Optional: Finish with 2–3 **slow chair sit-to-stands** holding dumbbells

## 💡 Notes

- Practice with breath and presence  
- Let the movement be devotional, not performative  
- Option to pair with mantra (e.g., *OM YEHOSHUA HUNG*) or silence  
- Respect pacing: avoid overexertion on low-energy days

Let the weight be lightened by awareness.”*
