## 🪑 Position

- Seated in a stable chair  
- Spine lifted, feet grounded  
- 5lb dumbbells resting by your sides  
- Practice in silence or with mantra as background awareness

---

> *“There is no health to be gained, no awakening to reach,  
no breath to perfect.  
This is not a practice of becoming.  
It is the breath, practiced as Being.”*

## 🌿 Orientation: Wu-Wei | The Path of No More Meditation

This ChairFlow sequence is not a technique to fix the body  
or to attain spiritual states.  
It is a movement offered in the spirit of **wu-wei**—**doing through non-doing**.

- No grasping  
- No goal  
- No outcome to monitor

Inspired by the **contemplative Dzogchen view of Namkhai Norbu** and the **Zen path of Shikantaza**, this is not yoga to improve—it is yoga to *dissolve into presence*.

> “The postures are not tools.  
They are windows.  
They open. You sit inside.”

Each breath, each motion, each pause is simply a gesture of **being here**—not toward anything. No success. No failure. Only return.

Let the dumbbells hang like unanswered questions.  
Let the breath carry no promise.  
Let the silence rise like dawn.

## 🧘‍♂️ 1. Rest & Breath Awareness

> “Let the dumbbells hang loosely by your sides.  
Close your eyes or soften your gaze.  
Bring gentle attention to the breath as it moves in and out of the body.”

- Sit for 1–2 minutes  
- Allow the body to settle  
- Let the breath rise and fall naturally  
- Feel the **weight of the dumbbells as anchors**

---

## 🏋️ 2. Dumbbell Breath Flow (One Side at a Time)

With each arm, complete the following breath-led cycle:

1. **Inhale:** Curl weight up to shoulder  
2. **Exhale:** Press overhead  
3. **Inhale:** Lower into triceps extension  
4. **Exhale:** Press upward again  
5. **Inhale:** Lower to shoulder  
6. **Exhale:** Lower to resting position

> “Let the movement follow the breath.  
Let the strength be gentle.  
Let the repetition become prayer.”

Repeat on opposite side.  
Optionally: Alternate sides for 2 full cycles.
