# 🧭 Orientation to the Pathless Path  
**Non-Goal Practice in ChairFlow and Beyond**

> *“This is the path of no more meditation.  
No ladder. No ascent.  
Only resting where you already are.”*

## 🌿 Intention

This reflection is foundational to the spirit of **ChairFlow Sequence 01**, and by extension, any movement practice that lives in the lineage of:

- **Zen Shikantaza** (just sitting)  
- **Dzogchen Contemplation** (presence beyond method)  
- **Taoist Wu-Wei** (effortless action)  
- The teachings of **Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche**  
- And the insight of **Tsongkhapa**: *“The path without a goal”*

This is yoga not for healing, not for enlightenment,  
but as a doorway into **naked awareness**—as it is.

## 🔍 Core Principles

- **No grasping** — no reaching for health, bliss, or awakening  
- **No technique to master** — postures are lived, not achieved  
- **No effort toward outcome** — the body moves as presence, not toward success  
- **No narrative of improvement** — this is not the path of becoming  
- **No duality of sacred/profane** — just breathing, just weight, just stillness

## 🧘 In Practice

When you sit in your chair,  
When you pick up the dumbbells,  
When you raise your arms or count your breath...

> Do not try to improve anything.  
> Do not even try to observe.

Let the moment **move itself**.

> “The breath is not for watching.  
It is for being.  
And you are not the one who practices.  
The practice practices itself.”  
— *after Namkhai Norbu*

This reflection is best read:
- Before beginning a new scroll
- When discouraged by progress
- When tempted to “optimize” your practice
- When the breath becomes an object instead of a home

> *“Let this be no more than it is.  
Not a ritual. Not a method. Not a salvation.  
Just movement, inside silence.”*
