# 🌿 YogaFlow  
**Embodied Awareness Practices for ME/CFS and the Contemplative Path**  
**By Richard**

This folder contains a growing collection of **adapted movement flows** and supporting reflections rooted in the contemplative path. Each practice honors slowness, breath, surrender, and the intelligence of pacing—especially for those living with **ME/CFS**.

These are not exercises.  
They are sacred movements of presence.  
The breath moves the body. The body breathes awareness.

## 📂 Folder Structure

### 🪑 ChairFlow/
Gentle, seated (and standing-supported) yoga flows.  
Adapted for red/yellow days and porch practice.  
Includes: dumbbell flows, breathwork, sit-to-stand sequences.

### 🌙 Reflections/
Written contemplations and orientation texts to ground your practice in non-doing, non-striving, and sacred presence.  
Draws from:
- Dzogchen (Namkhai Norbu)  
- Zen (Shikantaza, Dogen)  
- Taoist Wu-Wei  
- Christian Mysticism  
- Advaita Vedanta  

These reflections are not meant to be read as instruction,  
but as **companions to the breath**—quiet reminders of the view that animates the form.

## 🌈 Energy State Awareness

Practices are tagged or organized by pacing level:

- 🟥 **Red Day** – minimal movement, breath only  
- 🟡 **Yellow Day** – seated or gentle flow with pauses  
- 🟢 **Green Day** – extended, integrated practice  

Each sequence honors the need for deep pacing, stillness, and gentleness in the face of chronic fatigue and post-exertional vulnerability.

## 💫 Orientation

These are not fitness routines.  
They are invitations into **stillness**, **body-presence**, and the **pathless path**.

> “This is not movement toward God-consciousness.  
It is movement as God-consciousness.  
No arrival. No achievement.  
Only return.”
