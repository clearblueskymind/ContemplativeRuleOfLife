# 🪞 In His Image: To Reflect Love

> *“Being made in the image of God goes far beyond physical form—it's about reflecting God's nature. And above all, that nature is love.”*  
> — Richard, July 3, 2025

## 📖 Scripture Foundation

**1 John 4:8** — *“God is love.”*

The only direct identity the Bible gives God is not “God is power” or “God is thought,” but this: **God is love**.

To be made in God's image is to be designed as a reflection of that love—not merely to be loved, but to live it, to express it, to *become* it in relationship to others and to self.

## ✦ Core Realization

- The **Imago Dei** is not a physical template—it is a **spiritual function**
- To reflect God is to **radiate what God is**  
- Since God is love, our essential calling is to **become conduits of love**  
  - Patient  
  - Forgiving  
  - Compassionate  
  - Steady in kindness, even when misunderstood

## 🕊️ Living the Image

> *“When we embrace this truth, our whole life becomes a reflection,  
an image of God’s heart.”*

To walk, to speak, to offer a meal, to forgive silently—all become acts of divine resemblance.

This is not moral performance.  
It is contemplative embodiment.  
It is **recognizing what we already are**.

## 🧘‍♂️ Reflection Practice

- Sit in stillness  
- On the inhale, silently say:  
  > *“I am made in Your image”*  
- On the exhale:  
  > *“Let me reflect Your love”*

Remain in awareness of where love wants to shine through you—today, in small, quiet ways.
