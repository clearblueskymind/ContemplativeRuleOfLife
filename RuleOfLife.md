📜 Rule of Life

A Living Rhythm of Sacred Practice for Richard
Last updated: July 7, 2025


---

✨ Core Intention

To live as a contemplative monk-in-the-world, embodying mindfulness, rest, and sacred rhythm from waking to sleep, while honoring the physical realities of ME/CFS and the wisdom of the breath.

> “Let each breath be a turning.
Let each moment be devotion.”




---

🛌 1. Threshold Practice — Upon Waking

Remain in bed as awareness arises

Begin silently repeating:
 OM YEHOSHUA HUNG

Use mantra to anchor consciousness after dreams

If sleep returns, resume mantra upon next waking



---

🚿 2. Morning Bathroom Ritual

Toilet → wash hands with intention

Recite: Al-Nitilat Yadayim blessing

Cleanse face, neck, hair with residual water

Brush teeth with presence



---

🌿 3. Porch Presence & Sunrise Sitting

Fill water glass, water plants mindfully

Sit on porch (chair or cushion) facing fig tree

Practice mantra or Shikantaza in sunrise stillness

Optional noise-canceling headset to protect spoons

Mantras used:
 • OM YEHOSHUA HUNG
 • OM EHYEH ASHER EHYEH HUNG
 • Yeho / Shua (inhale / exhale breath prayer)



---

🪑 4. Morning Yoga: ChairFlow or Zafu-Based Sequences

Choose based on energy state (Red / Yellow / Green):

Seated 5lb Dumbbell Flow (breath-synchronized)

Kapalabhati (1–3 rounds, ending with 3rd eye focus)

Sit–Stand Squats (with or without weights)

Resting Squat + spinal release

Seiza Bench Meditation

Spinal Flow: neck rolls, hip circles, backbend

Final Seal: Shikantaza (half-lotus or chair)

Transition Posture: Royal Seated Balance


All practice is framed by non-doing, non-striving, rooted in:

> “This is not movement toward God-consciousness.
It is movement as God-consciousness.”
