# Aphorism 001 — I Am, Therefore I Am

> **“I am, therefore I am.”**

---

### ✦ Summary:
A reversal of Descartes’ “I think, therefore I am,” this aphorism removes cognition from the seat of certainty and places **being** at the root of all presence. It echoes the Divine voice in Exodus 3:14 — *Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh* — and affirms that **existence is not justified by thought, but revealed in silence.**

### 🪶 Commentary:
This aphorism is not epistemology—it is **revelation**.

It arises not from doubt, but from stillness.  
It does not prove that you exist; it reminds you that you always already do.

Or simply rest in the silence between the words.
